                    It should be noted that cryptocurrency trading can be a highly risky investment and should be
                    approached with caution, especially during times of extreme volatility. Data suggests that roughly
                    70% of investors will lose money at some point in time. However, the market can also be quite
                    lucrative with the right trades.
